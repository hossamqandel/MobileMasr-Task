- Glide: Glide is an image loading library for Android that efficiently loads and displays images from various sources with caching support.

- SwipeToRefresh: a UI pattern for adding pull-to-refresh functionality to RecyclerViews or scrollable views, allowing users to update content with a swipe gesture.

Navigation Component: Simplifies implementing navigation in Android apps by providing tools to design and manage navigation paths between screens.

- Room Database: A SQLite object mapping library for Android that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite databases, simplifying database operations with compile-time verification of queries.
